## L0 - Extract and Reverse a Portion of an Array

**Problem Statement:**
Given an array of integers ``` [15, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90]```, write a function extractAndReverse that performs the following tasks:

* Use the slice method to extract a subarray from the third element (inclusive) to the fifth element (exclusive).
* Reverse the extracted subarray and return it.
* The original array should remain unchanged. The function should return the reversed subarray.

## L1 - Implementing Multiple Custom Methods for Array Operations

# Problem Statement:
Create a program that defines the following custom methods:

```filterEvenNumbers(arr)```: This method takes an array of numbers and returns a new array with only the even numbers using filter.
```sumOfArray(arr)```: This method calculates and returns the sum of all elements in an array using reduce.
```sortAndConcat(arr1, arr2)```: This method takes two arrays of numbers, sorts each array in ascending order using sort, and then concatenates them into one array using concat. Return the sorted and concatenated array.
**Your program should:**

* Take two input arrays of numbers.
* Use the custom methods to filter, sum, sort, and concatenate the arrays.
* Output the results of each operation.

## L1 - Debugging an Array and String Manipulation Program

**Problem Statement**:
You are given a program that manipulates an array of student names. However, there are several bugs in the code that need to be fixed. Your task is to debug the program and make sure it works correctly. The program should perform the following:

* Add a new student name at a specific position using splice.
* Check if a student's name exists in the array using includes.
* Convert the array of student names into a single string where names are separated by commas using join.
==The existing code is as follows:==
```javascript
function manageStudents() {
    let students = ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"];
    // Add "David" at index 1
    students.splice(1, 0, "David");
    // Check if "Eve" is in the list
    console.log(students.includes("Eve"));  // Should return false
    // Convert the array to a string with names separated by commas
    console.log(students.join(","));  // Expected: "Alice,David,Bob,Charlie"
}

manageStudents();
```
**Tasks:**
* Fix any bugs in the code.
* Write test cases to ensure that adding, searching, and joining operations are working as expected.
* Ensure that the program works for different cases (e.g., adding at different positions, checking different names).

## L1 - JSON Stringify and Parse Operations
**Problem Statement:**
 Write a JavaScript program that:

* Takes a JavaScript object with user details such as name, age, email, and isAdmin.
* Converts it into a JSON string using JSON.stringify().
* Stores it in a variable and then parses it back to a JavaScript object using JSON.parse().
* Accesses and prints the values of each key from the parsed object.
**Example**
```javascript
Input:
const user = {
  name: "John Doe",
  age: 25,
  email: "john@example.com",
  isAdmin: false
};

Output:
Name: John Doe
Age: 25
Email: john@example.com
Admin: false
```
**Note**:
* Ensure the data is not modified during stringify/parse cycle.
* Console log each key's value after parsing.

# Q: 15
## L1 - Managing Student List with JSON Methods
**Problem Statement:**
You're given an array of student names. Your task is to write a program that:

* Adds a new student name at a specific index using splice().
* Checks whether a student's name exists using includes().
* Converts the final array into a comma-separated string using join().
* Also, debug the following code snippet and make necessary corrections:
```javascript
    function manageStudents() {
      let students = ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"];
      // Add "David" at index 1
      students.splice(1, 0, "David");
      // Check if "Eve" is in the list
      console.log(students.includes("Eve"));  // Should return false
      // Convert the array to a string with names separated by commas
      console.log(students.join(","));  // Expected: "Alice,David,Bob,Charlie"
    }
    
    manageStudents();
```
**Tasks**:
+ Debug any logical issues.
+ Add additional test cases to ensure proper functioning.
